# Prompt Engineering in Vibe Coding
Prompt Engineering is the practice of writing structured, detailed, and strategic instructions that guide an AI model to produce the exact output you need—whether that’s code, design, documentation, or architecture.

## Why Prompt Engineering Matters in Development

AI understands what you mean, not just what you type. So when prompts are vague, the code is vague.<br>
When prompts are clear, AI behaves like a <b>senior engineer</b>.<br>

Prompt engineering helps you:
* Generate clean and modular code
* Reduce debugging time
* Speed up development by 10×
* Improve code quality and architecture
* Build complex features with simple instructions
